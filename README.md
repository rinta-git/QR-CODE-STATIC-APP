## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma designs

### What I learned

Revised the use of flexbox and usage of css variables.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1 for CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/) - This website helped me for quick recap over css properties. I really liked this detailed explanation and will use it going forward.
- [Video resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSw6bPXZks&ab_channel=CoderCoder) - This is an amazing youtube video which helped me finally understand why not to use px instead of rem for font-size. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
